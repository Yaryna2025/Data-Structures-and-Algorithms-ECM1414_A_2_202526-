pseudocode for brute force

FUNCTION read_input_file(filename):
    activities = empty list

    open the file
    read the number of activities (first line)

    read max_time and max_budget (second line)

    for each of the remaining lines (one per activity):
        read: name, time_required, cost, enjoyment
        store those values in a dictionary/record
        add it to activities

    close the file
    return activities, max_time, max_budget


FUNCTION brute_force(activities, max_time, max_budget):
    best_activities = empty list
    best_enjoyment = 0

    try every possible combination of activities:
        work out total_time and total_cost for that combination

        if (total_cost and total_time) is within the limit:
            work out total_enjoyment

            if this enjoyment is better than the best so far:
                update best_enjoyment
                update best_activities

    return best_activities, best_enjoyment


FUNCTION print_solution(best_activities, best_enjoyment, max_time):
    print max_time
    print best_enjoyment
    print how many activities were chosen

    total_time = 0
    total_cost = 0

    for each activity in best_activities:
        print the activity details
        add its time to total_time
        add its cost to total_cost

    print total_time
    print total_cost
    print best_enjoyment


MAIN PROGRAM:
    ask user for the input filename
    read in the activities and constraints from the file
    run brute_force to find the best set of activities
    print out the results
