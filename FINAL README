Student Society Event Planner - README

========
Overview
========

This is ECM1414 Algorithms and Data Structures coursework, where we develop
an Event Planner that selects the optimal combination of activities to maximise enjoyment while considering time and budget constraints.

The program implements and compares:
- Brute-force algorithm
- Dynamic programming algorithm, which is more efficient approach

Both algorithms process the same input and output the chosen activities, totals, and execution time.

==============
Files Included
==============

- event_planner_with_extension.py - Final version including brute-force and dynamic programming algorithms (WITH extension)
- event_planner.py - Final version including brute-force and dynamic programming algorithms (WITHOUT extension)
- Input_Files/input_small.txt - Sample input file (small dataset)
- Input_Files/input_medium.txt - Sample input file (medium dataset)
- Input_Files/input_large.txt - Sample input file (large dataset)
- pseudocode_brute_force.txt - Brute-force algorithm pseudocode
- README.txt - This file

============
Requirements
============

- Python 3 (no additional libraries required; only standard libraries are used)
- Portable code that can run on any machine with Python 3 installed

===================
Running the Program
===================

1. Open a terminal/command prompt and go to the project directory.
2. Run the program:
   python event_planner_with_extension.py
3. Follow the prompts to select an input size: small, medium, large, or 'e' to exit.
4. The program will read the corresponding input file from the Input_Files folder.

Place your files as required:

- The main code file `event_planner_with_extension.py` and `event_planner` should be in a folder named `Code/`.
- The input files (`input_small.txt`, `input_medium.txt`, `input_large.txt`) should be in a folder named `Input_Files/`, located at the same level as `Code/`.
- The pseudocode file `pseudo_code_event_planner.txt` should be also placed in the `Code/` folder.
- The README file should be at the root of the project folder.

=================
Input File Format
=================

Text file structure:

n
T B
Each of the next n lines must contain a single-word activity name followed by time, cost, and enjoyment values.

Explanation of each part of the structure:
- n = number of activities
- T = maximum available time (hours)
- B = maximum budget (£)
- Activity line format: <name> <time> <cost> <enjoyment>

======
Output
======

For each algorithm, the program displays:
1. Input File, which shows the name of the input file being used
2. Selected Activities: List of chosen activities with time, cost, and enjoyment
3. Total Enjoyment: Sum of enjoyment values
4. Total Time Used: Sum of time required
5. Total Cost: Sum of costs
6. Available Time and Budget, which displays constraints
7. Execution Time: Time taken by the algorithm

Example output for `input_small.txt`, where execution times may be different each time:

=====
Notes
=====

- Each activity can only be selected once.
- The program ensures both time and budget constraints are respected.
- Brute-force algorithm is appropriate for small input sizes; dynamic programming can handle medium and large inputs efficiently.
- Both algorithms are run on the same input for performance comparison.
